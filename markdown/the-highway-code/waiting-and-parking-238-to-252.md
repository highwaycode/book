<h2>Parking (rules 239 to 247)</h2>
<h3>Rule 239</h3>
<p>Use off-street parking areas, or bays marked out with white lines on the road as parking places, wherever possible. If you have to stop on the roadside:</p>
<ul><li>do not park facing against the traffic flow</li>
<li>stop as close as you can to the side</li>
<li>do not stop too close to a vehicle displaying a Blue Badge: remember, the occupant may need more room to get in or out</li>
<li>you <strong>MUST</strong>
switch off the engine, headlights and fog lights</li>
<li>you <strong>MUST</strong>
apply the handbrake before leaving the vehicle</li>
<li>you <strong>MUST</strong>
ensure you do not hit anyone when you open your door. Check for cyclists or other traffic</li>
<li>it is safer for your passengers (especially children) to get out of the vehicle on the side next to the kerb</li>
<li>put all valuables out of sight and make sure your vehicle is secure</li>
<li>lock your vehicle.</li>
</ul>
<p>Before using a hand-held device to help you to park, you <strong>MUST</strong>
make sure it is safe to do so. Then, you should move the vehicle into the parking space in the safest way, and by the shortest route possible.</p>
<p>When you use a hand-held device to help you to park, you <strong>MUST</strong>
remain in control of the vehicle at all times. Do not use the hand-held device for anything else while you are using it to help you park, and do not put anyone in danger. Use the hand-held device according to the manufacturer’s instructions.</p>
