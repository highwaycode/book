## Traffic light signals

 RED means ‘Stop’. Wait behind the stop line on the carriageway 

 RED AND AMBER also means ‘Stop’. Do not pass through or start until GREEN shows 

 GREEN means you may go on if the way is clear. Take special care if you intend to turn left or right and give way to pedestrians who are crossing 

 AMBER means ‘Stop’ at the stop line. You may go on only if the AMBER appears after you have crossed the stop line or are so close to it that  to pull up might cause an accident 

 A GREEN ARROW may be provided in addition to the full green signal if movement in a certain direction is allowed before or after the full green phase. If the way  is clear you may go but only in the direction shown by  the arrow. You may do this whatever other lights may be showing. White light signals may be provided for trams
