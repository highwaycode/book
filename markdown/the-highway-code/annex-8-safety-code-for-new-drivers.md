<h1>Annex 8. Safety code for new drivers</h1>
<p>Information about the safety code for new drivers, including the New Drivers Act and further training.</p>
<p>Once you have passed the driving test you will be able to drive on your own. This will provide you with lots of opportunities but you need to remain safe. Even though you have shown you have the skills you need to drive safely, many newly qualified drivers lack experience. You need to continue to develop your skills, especially anticipating other road users’ behaviour to avoid having a collision. As many as one new driver in five has some kind of collision in their first year of driving. This code provides advice to help you get through the first twelve months after passing the driving test, when you are most vulnerable, as safely as possible.</p>
<h2>The safety code</h2>
<ul><li>Many of the worst collisions happen at night. Between midnight and 6 am is a time of high risk for new drivers. Avoid driving then unless it’s really necessary.</li>
<li>If you are driving with passengers, you are responsible for their safety. Don’t let them distract you or encourage you to take risks. Tell your passengers that you need to concentrate if you are to get to your destination safely.</li>
<li>Never show off or try to compete with other drivers, particularly if they are driving badly.</li>
<li>Don’t drive if you have consumed any alcohol or taken drugs. Even over-the-counter medicines can affect your ability to drive safely - read the label to see if they may affect your driving.</li>
<li>Make sure everyone in the car is wearing a seat belt throughout the journey.</li>
<li>Keep your speed down - many serious collisions happen because the driver loses control, particularly on bends.</li>
<li>Most new drivers have no experience of driving high-powered or sporty cars. Unless you have learnt to drive in such a vehicle you need to get plenty of experience driving on your own before driving a more powerful car.</li>
<li>Driving while uninsured is an offence. See <a href='annex-3-motor-vehicle-documentation-and-learner-driver-requirements.md'>Annex 3</a> for information on types of insurance cover.</li>
</ul>
<h2>New Drivers Act</h2>
<p><strong>REMEMBER</strong>
that under the New Drivers Act you will have your licence revoked if you get six penalty points on your licence within two years of passing your first driving test. You will need to pass both the theory and practical tests again to get back your full licence.</p>
