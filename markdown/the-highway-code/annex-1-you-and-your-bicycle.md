<p><strong>Cycle training</strong>
can help both children and adults, especially those adults returning to cycling to develop the skills needed to cycle safely on todayâ€™s roads. A new national cycle training standard has been developed which the Government is promoting and making funding available for delivery in schools.</p>
<p>All cyclists should consider the benefits of undertaking cycle training. For information, contact your local authority.</p>
